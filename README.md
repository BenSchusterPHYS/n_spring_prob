# Mass‐and‐Springs Simulator

##  What?

This is a program, written mostly in python, that simulations the motion of a mass attached to to several springs. It is very much a work in progress, and I hope to make improvements in the future. Should this project be a success there are several other "pet projects" similar to this I would like to pursue. 

## Why? 

This is a personal project created by me to improve my python skills, as well as improve and test numerical methods in a fun and creative environment. This project is by no means designed to be optimized or solve some great problem, it is a space for me to learn and better my skills. I also acknowledge that I am likely not the first to ever create such a program, that said, I try to refrain from seeking "inspiration" from others who have solved this problem before me. The goal is to learn. To that end, here are the skills I hope to enhance through this project:

- Simulating physical phenomena in Python  
- Implementing various numerical methods  
- Working with Git and GitHub  
- Managing a self‑directed coding project


## Who?

I am an undergraduate physics and math double major with hopes to pursue graduate school in physics. I hope to build skills though this project that will help me succeed in my career and in my life. I have found that I learn the best by *doing*, and this project is a step in that direction. 

## When?

Because of my academic and personal life I do not have great amounts of time to spend working on this project. Updates will likely be few and far between. 

## Whats next?

I hope to add a better numerical solution to Newton's second law of motion. Currently I use a simple Euler's method. Implementing RK4 or even RK4-5 are plans for the future. Also, adding the ability for user input. I am also considering adding damping, which the user can specify. I do not have concrete plans for this yet.
